Front-End Dev // Terminal-addict // CSS-JS Wizardry Enthusiast

Hi, I’m Sola (Sho.la) 

I build bold, fast, slightly overdesigned websites with React/Next, Tailwind & GSAP/Motion (I tried Bootstrap a couple times and now I know why there's "trap" in the name).
Constantly learning, actually digging through PHP while rebuilding my portfolio for the 7th time.

Pixel-perfect UIs (addict), brutalist design, obsessed with speed: shortcuts everywhere—and yes, I’m absolutely waiting for the perfect moment to flex them..
I'm a developer with a designer’s brain and a terminal full of tabs (Don't even think about looking at my browser tabs!).

Motto: “Eating code is better than.. not eating at all? Nevermind..”

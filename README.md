Front-End Dev - Learning Back-End // Terminal-addict // CSS Wizardry Enthusiast

Hi, I’m Sola (Sho.la  --> That's how it's pronounced, say it out loud, it will be okay) 👋

Currently trapped in Neovim, send help (or at least a good theme).

I build bold, fast, slightly overdesigned websites with React, Next & Tailwind (I tried Bootstrap a couple times and now I know why there's "trap" in the name).
Learning to juggle PHP, and way too many tutorials on "How to write a clean controller" but the truth is I hate that language and it hates me back.

Occasionally talks to databases, lover of pixel-perfect UIs (addict), brutalist design, and shortcuts I will 100% forget tomorrow.
I'm a developer with a designer’s brain and a terminal full of tabs (Don't even think about looking at my browser tabs!).

✨ Motto: “Eating code is better than eating sh***.”
